## How to run

### Back

(I'll simplify this soon with a docker composer)

**You need PostgresQL installed with root access !**

#### In the server folder

Changes .env with

```shell
postgresql:/<YOURNAME>:<YOURPASSWORD>@localhost:5432/<YOURDBNAME>
```

```shell
yarn
```

First terminal tab

```shell
yarn watch
```

Second terminal tab

```shell
yarn dev
```

Server should be started and migration (InitialDB) runs with a clean database.

### Front

#### In the client folder

```shell
yarn
```

```shell
yarn dev
```
